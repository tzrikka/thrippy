# GitHub Apps: Installation Notes

Anyone can install GitHub Apps on their personal account.

Organization owners can install GitHub Apps on their organization.

Admins of repositories that are owned by an organization can also install GitHub Apps on the organization if they only grant the app access to repositories that they are an admin of and if the app does not request any organization permissions or the "repository administration" permission.

Organization owners can prevent outside collaborators who are repository admins from installing GitHub Apps.
